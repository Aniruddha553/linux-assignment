this is my first linux assignment.
in my previous file i created and deleted 3 lines using the dd and 3dd command.
we just have to place the cursor at the start of the line then we jut have to 
exit insert mode and type (:dd) od (:3dd) to delete one line or three lines 
simultaneously.
now i will be merging this file with my previous file using the cat command
this is a new linux file that i created.
i created this file using vi editor.
vi is a great editor . 
i think i will be using vi from now on.
linux is a great OS for managing many different users.
i makes managing user accounts easier.
thats why most companies prefer linux over windows or mac OS
i think i will be using linux from now on.
it provides an interactive GUI which is much easier to user.
the linux terminal is much easy to use and understand and makes the processes easir
